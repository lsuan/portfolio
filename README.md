### Tech Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

### Summary and Takeaways
- Designed the entire website by myself and chose a consistent color scheme that makes certain UI elements pop out
- Used <code>Context</code> to save the state of the theme and display the necessary styling and icon changes for light / dark mode toggling
- Included **Bootstrap** for tab and modal functionality, and as a base for overall frontend styling
- Images are *lazy loaded*, and gifs were compressed to improve site performance
- Chose **Netlify** to host the site and used their form functionality to make a contact form
- Contact form uses <code>State</code> to trigger a success message on form submission
- Routing was implemented using <code>BrowserRouter</code>; checks were implemented with <code>useRef</code> and <code>onClick</code> events to get the window to scroll to each section properly on the home page
- Fully responsive website
